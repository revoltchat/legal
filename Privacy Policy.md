# Privacy Policy

_Note: Please be aware that only our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy in English are legally binding. While translations of these documents may be provided for your convenience, they are translated by the community and are thus not legal documents._

This Privacy Policy applies to the official instance of Revolt, available at revolt.chat. Self-hosted instances may choose to adopt this Privacy Policy if they wish.

### Introduction

We get that legal documents can be overwhelming and boring, so we've tried our best to keep it as simple and possible while providing the information needed. It is important however to remember that these terms are legally binding between yourself and us if you choose to use Revolt, so please read them carefully before proceeding - We will continue to improve and tackle some sections.

### Your Privacy

Your privacy is very important to us, and we will ensure protecting your privacy when using our services.

**Revolt** is an open-source project (source code is available on our [GitHub](https://github.com/revoltchat)), and we respect our user's privacy while remaining transparent with our users. We only collect limited data from our users that is absolutely necessary.

- **Account Information**: We collect data from our users when they register for an account on Revolt, such as: the registered e-mail address, hashed password, and chosen username.

### hCaptcha

> This section has been adapted from hCaptcha's documentation.

We use the hCaptcha anti-bot service (hereinafter "hCaptcha") on our website. This service is provided by Intuition Machines, Inc., a Delaware US Corporation ("IMI"). hCaptcha is used to check whether the data entered on our website (such as on a login page or contact form) has been entered by a human or by an automated program. To do this, hCaptcha analyzes the behavior of the website or mobile app visitor based on various characteristics. This analysis starts automatically as soon as the website or mobile app visitor enters a part of the website or app with hCaptcha enabled.

When using the [Revolt App](https://app.revolt.chat), hCaptcha will only begin analysis when you:

- Submit a login request.
- Submit a registration request.
- Submit a password reset / email resend request.

For the analysis, hCaptcha evaluates various information (e.g. IP address, how long the visitor has been on the website or app, or mouse movements made by the user). The data collected during the analysis will be forwarded to IMI.

Data processing is based on Art. 6(1)(f) of the GDPR (DSGVO): the website or mobile app operator has a legitimate interest in protecting its site from abusive automated crawling and spam. IMI acts as a "data processor" acting on behalf of its customers as defined under the GDPR, and a "service provider" for the purposes of the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA). For more information about hCaptcha and IMI's privacy policy and terms of use, please visit the following links: [https://hcaptcha.com/privacy/](https://hcaptcha.com/privacy/) and [https://hcaptcha.com/terms](https://hcaptcha.com/terms).
